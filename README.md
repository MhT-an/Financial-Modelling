# Financial-Modelling and Computation
Valuation of exotic options with Binomial Tree, Forward Shooting Grid, Black-Scholes PDE and discretized FDS, Monte-Carlo and variance reduction methods etc.

Topics includes:
1. Mathematical models for pricing exotic options, implementation of numerical methods such as binomial tree methods, finite difference lattices and Monte Carlo methods for pricing exotic options.
2. Hands on financial modelling of exotic options as well as writing and presenting a project report.
